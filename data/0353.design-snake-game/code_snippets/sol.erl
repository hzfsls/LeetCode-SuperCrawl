-spec snake_game_init_(Width :: integer(), Height :: integer(), Food :: [[integer()]]) -> any().

%% Your functions will be called as such:
%% snake_game_init_(Width, Height, Food),
%% Param_1 = snake_game_move(Direction),

%% snake_game_init_ will be called before every test case, in which you can do some necessary initializations.

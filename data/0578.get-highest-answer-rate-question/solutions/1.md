##### 思路

- 如何计算回答率？

`sum(action = 'answer') / sum(action = 'show')`

- 根据回答率排倒序
  - `order by sum(action = 'answer') / sum(action = 'show') desc, question_id`
  - `dense_rank() over(order by sum(action = 'answer') / sum(action = 'show') desc, question_id)`
- 取第一个

##### 答案

```sql
# order by 
select question_id as survey_log
from SurveyLog
group by question_id
order by sum(action = 'answer') / sum(action = 'show') desc, question_id
limit 1

# having >= all 也是可以的，这里省略


# rnk
select
    question_id as survey_log
from
(select
    a.*,
    dense_rank() over(order by sum(action = 'answer') / sum(action = 'show') desc, question_id) as rnk
 # 这里用dense_rank或者其他都可以，因为不存在平局的情况
from SurveyLog a
group by question_id) t
where rnk=1
```

解法一：
```sql
select distinct user_id
from (
    select
        user_id,
        count(*) over(
            partition by user_id
            order by time_stamp
            range between interval 24 hour preceding and current row
            ) cnt
    from confirmations
) tmp
where cnt>1;
```
注意：
> 以下四种表达都可以：
> - `range between interval 1 day preceding and current row`
> - `range between interval 24 hour preceding and current row`
> - `range between current row and interval 1 day following`
> - `range between current row and interval 24 hour following`

解法二：
```sql
select
    distinct c1.user_id
from confirmations c1
join confirmations c2 on
    c1.user_id = c2.user_id and
    c1.time_stamp <> c2.time_stamp and
    abs(timestampdiff(
        second,
        c1.time_stamp,
        c2.time_stamp)
        )<=24*60*60;
```
注意：
> `timestampdiff`的用法。

解法三：
```sql
select
    distinct c1.user_id
from confirmations c1
join confirmations c2 on
    c1.user_id = c2.user_id and
    c1.time_stamp <> c2.time_stamp and
    timestampdiff(
        second,
        c1.time_stamp,
        c2.time_stamp
        ) between 1 and 24*60*60;
```

解法四：
```sql
select
    distinct c1.user_id
from confirmations c1
join confirmations c2 on
    c1.user_id = c2.user_id and
    c1.time_stamp <> c2.time_stamp and
    (to_seconds(c1.time_stamp) - to_seconds(c2.time_stamp))
        between 1 and 24*60*60;
```
注意：
> `to_seconds`的用法。

解法五：
```sql
select
    distinct c1.user_id
from confirmations c1
join confirmations c2 on
    c1.user_id = c2.user_id and
    c1.time_stamp > c2.time_stamp and
    c1.time_stamp <= date_add(c2.time_stamp, interval 1 day);
```

### 解题思路
三个临时列表 注意当Senior最低工资高于70000时变成null 需要过滤

### 代码

```mysql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH SeniorTotal AS
(SELECT employee_id, SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS totalone
FROM Candidates
WHERE experience = 'Senior'),

SeniorNumber AS 
(SELECT MAX(totalone) totals 
FROM SeniorTotal
WHERE totalone <= 70000),

JuniorTotal  AS 
(SELECT employee_id, SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS totaltwo
FROM Candidates
WHERE experience = 'Junior')

SELECT 'Senior' AS experience, COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) AS accepted_candidates
FROM SeniorTotal
WHERE totalone <= 70000
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Junior' AS experience, COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) AS accepted_candidates
FROM JuniorTotal, SeniorNumber
WHERE totaltwo < 70000 - IFNULL(totals, 0)

```
